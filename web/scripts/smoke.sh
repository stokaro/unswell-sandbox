# Smoke-test a deployed playground over the network.
#
# Two things can only be measured against the real origin:
#
#   1. Whether the CDN in front of GitHub Pages compresses a 46 MB asset. The
#      whole loading experience assumes a cold visit transfers ~21 MB rather
#      than ~46 MB, and the 100 GB/month Pages bandwidth allowance assumes the
#      same. The script reports the measured number either way, and warns
#      loudly on the bad one.
#
#   2. Whether the bytes a visitor receives are the bytes that were built. The
#      body is hashed and compared against the sha256 in the manifest the same
#      origin served, so artifact packing, CDN rewriting or a truncated upload
#      show up here rather than as a WebAssembly compile error in a stranger's
#      browser.
#
# Usage:
#   web/scripts/smoke.sh https://play.unswell.dev/ [expected-unswell-commit]
#
# Exit status is 1 for a broken deploy. A missing content-encoding is a
# warning, not a failure: the site works, it is just expensive.
